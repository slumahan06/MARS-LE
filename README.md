# MARS Custom Language: We the People
By Sean Lumahan

Welcome to my custom MARS programming language called 
**"We the People,"** a language that is themed around U.S. history and government.
I created this language because I have an interest in political science, and
wanted to combine it with my interest in programming!

The result was a programming language that acts similar to that of a game, where you
try to keep the United States afloat. Registers act as the "stats" of the nation,
including the parties in control, GDP, and stability. The functions listed below
all revolve around these statistics, all of them either modifying their values or
checking if they equal to a specific number.

All **21 functions** planned out in Module 1 are implemented:
- revolt $t0, $t1
- state
- cwar
- lpur
- factory
- moon
- gov
- leg
- corr
- pun
- nun
- pelect
- melect
- mlaw
- fight
- econ
- actpres
- switch
- ref
- query
- revert

To use this custom programming language, simply run the Mars.jar file. In the toolbar,
go to Tools -> Language Switcher and select "We the People." Three example programs are
included to test and try for yourself!
