# MARS Custom Language: We the People
By Sean Lumahan

Welcome to my custom MARS programming language called 
**"We the People,"** a language that is themed around U.S. history and government.

All **21 functions** planned out in Module 1 are implemented:
- revolt
- state
- cwar
- lpur
- factory
- moon
- gov
- leg
- corr
- pun
- nun
- pelect
- melect
- mlaw
- fight
- econ
- actpres
- switch
- ref
- query
- revert

To use this custom programming language, simply run the Mars.jar file. In the toolbar,
go to Tools -> Language Switcher and select "We the People." Three example programs are
included to test and try for yourself!
